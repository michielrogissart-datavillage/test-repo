  summary: Store secret
  description: >
    Stores the content of the request as a secret in the cage. Secrets that already exist will be overwritten. 
    A secret can be encrypted with the public key of the cage. The cage will then have access to the decrypted version.
    This encryption should be done client side such that the platform never sees the decrypted data.
